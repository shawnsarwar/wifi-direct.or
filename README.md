# wifi-direct.or

This was a small PoC I did to look at the feasibility of using tcp/ip over a wifi-direct connection, with the longer term aim of synching CouchDB / Couchbase databases while offline. This app allows the sharing of an active wifi connection to another user over Wifi direct. Just a simple proxy which makes the internet available to the "offline" user.
